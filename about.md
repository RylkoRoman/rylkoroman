I’m the Chief Technology Officer at Pynest. I lead the technical direction across our projects, helping startups and enterprise teams design scalable, maintainable systems — especially in fintech, healthcare, and data-heavy industries. My core expertise is in backend development (Python, Go), infrastructure as code (Terraform, Kubernetes), and building DevOps practices that actually reduce friction instead of adding more tools.
Over the past 7+ years, I’ve worked with distributed teams to launch products in banking, logistics, and analytics. At Pynest, I try to keep engineering practical — fast iteration, clear boundaries, and tech choices that match business stage, not buzzwords.
